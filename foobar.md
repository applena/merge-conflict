# merge-conflict
Hey turkey's  - here is the first line
What is brown and sticky?
chocolate or poop
branches after they fall in mud!
Well now I'm committed.

Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice started off great. One pair made a change and pushed it - although they should have made a new branch first. Then they all updated their local machine with the master.

Then, both pairs created a new branch but were working on the same file. That's not a good thing. 

Anyhow, Carol worked it all out and they updated their local machine with the now clean master.

However, the love didn't last because both teams immediatly started programing from the master instead of making a new branch. This caused the internet to explode aka made the second team create a new branch in order to merge.
